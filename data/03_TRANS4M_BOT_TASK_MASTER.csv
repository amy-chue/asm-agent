FA acceptance criteria have been developed to ensure focus on the events that have the highest impact on ASM and its Customers. Global Product Support may choose to accept an FA case that does not meet the acceptance criteria for a variety of reasons and disposition data must be captured for all FA case requests. However, for the purpose of goal setting and Customer commitments, Overall Cycle time and First Pass Acceptance will only be presented for Customer requested HIGH PRIORITY approved cases as defined below.
Global Product Support will accept the FA request as a HIGH PRIORITY based on the following criteria:
If the failure is believed to be the root cause or key contributor of a safety near miss or safety incident.
If the failure is believed to be the root cause or key contributor to a Customer wafer scrap event or high impact yield issue
If the failure is believed to be the root cause of an extended tool down time or unduly delaying Install and Qualification or customer development or production.
If the failure occurs during Install & Qualification, the first year of a new tool warranty, a parts contract, or 3-month part warranty period.
Part failures post warranty if:The failure is a repeat event for this Customer, ≥ 2 events within a 3 month period
>3 worldwide warranty incidents of this type of failure in the last 12 months.
Note: Failures attributable to a tool or spare parts being used outside of documented/agreed ASM specifications and process limits, Customer declined or incompletely deployed Field Change Orders, lack of preventative maintenance or Customer performed maintenance not to ASMs recommended maintenance schedules will not be included in the KPI Measurements or qualify for unpaid Failure Analysis.","Fiori QM02: Change Quality Notification for Quality Engineer (Application),
